# Stithulf ERC: An Open Source Application for Lending Services

Hello Stithulf Community and Contributors ðŸ‘‹

The following project creates a basic web interface for inception stage of the Lending Service.

Q. How lending procedure works?

- The lending procedure will occur in 3 stages.

Stage 1: User fills the application form from homepage

Stage 2: The user gets contacted and the flexible repayment structuring is done using email (info@stithulf.com)

Stage 3: The user accesses funds and will have to repay the funds within the repayment period

We have aim to build newer versions of an application where, all of the lending activities will occur on the website ðŸŽ¯

Please feel free to contribute to our lending project. All contributors will be credited for the work ðŸ“™
